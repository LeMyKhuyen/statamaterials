# BUSS7902 Quantitative Business Research Methods

This repository is prepared for the optional Stata workshop of BUSS7902 Quantitative Business Research Methods at the University of Sydney in 2023.

The target audience is all Business School first-year MPhil and PhD students without prior Stata & statistic knowledge. Readers are also suggested to check out the [Stata Workshop series on my website](https://mingze-gao.com/finc50/stata/). Relevant links are provided also in the workshop structure below.

To use the materials, please download this repository to a local computer with Stata 16 or above installed. Then follow the structure listed below, open the associated Stata `do` files and execute as instructed.

## Structure of the workshop

### Introduction to Stata

First, [Stata Introduction](https://mingze-gao.com/finc50/stata/introduction/) on my website provides basic background knowledge of using Stata from its GUI, working directory, to some demonstrations of Stata commands. The `code/introduction.do` file in this repo also provides some basic usage examples.

> Stata is made powerful thanks to the many additional commands built and published by scholars. These commands can be installed via [packages](https://mingze-gao.com/finc50/stata/packages/).

Before we proceed to the next section, it is useful to have a detailed look at [working with datasets](https://mingze-gao.com/finc50/stata/working-with-datasets/) to learn the ways of importing/exporting datasets in different formats, such as the Stata's native `dta` file, the `csv` files, as well as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.

### Statistical Inference
